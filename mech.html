              <p class="card-text shadow-sm p-3 mb-5 bg-white rounded">One of the oldest and broadest fields of engineering, Mechanical engineering deals with the design, construction, and use of machines. The programme endows students with the basic understanding and knowledge of how heavy tools and machineries work. A student pursuing a mechanical engineering programme will acquire knowledge about designing of automobiles, electric motors, aircrafts and other heavy vehicles.

                Mechanical engineers design everything from new batteries, athletic equipment to medical devices and from personal computers, air conditioners, automobile engines to electric power plants. These engineers also design machines that produce these innovations.
                
                The scope of mechanical engineering in India and abroad is huge for every aspect of our lives are touched by mechanical engineering in one way of the other. Spanning multiple industries, the career opportunities for students pursuing the programme is huge.
                
                In India, Mechanical engineering is offered by various colleges in India at the UG as well PG level where students are awarded BTech and MTech degree respectively.</p>
